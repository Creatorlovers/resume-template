# **Open-source resume template**

This project was given to me as a means to develop my programming skills. Don't be too harsh please n_n.

## Mostly HTML based for now

Because of what I said above, it will mostly be based on HTML code for now (with a bit of CSS attributes in it).

## Motivation

- GET BETTER and become a badass Web Designer maybe Developer.
- Become more comfortable using code and be more confident about it.

## Your HELP and suggestions

I'm open to hear your suggestions concerning my proceedings, tutorials that you think would help me, etc. Your help would be greatly appreciated! ^^
